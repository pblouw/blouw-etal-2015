Nengo
==================================

Nengo is a suite of software used to build and simulate
large-scale brain models using the methods of the
`Neural Engineering Framework
<http://compneuro.uwaterloo.ca/research/nef.html>`_.

   installation

If you're new to Nengo, start with the basic API
and the associated examples.

Once you're comfortable with making simple Nengo models,
you can start making more advanced simulations by
setting additional options on the Nengo objects
in your model and using templates.

If the advanced API is not sufficient for the model
that you want to create, then you have to look past
the API to how the underlying objects
that Nengo simulators use and manipulate.

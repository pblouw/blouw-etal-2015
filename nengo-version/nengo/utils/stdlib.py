def groupby(objects, key, hashable=None, force_list=True):
    """Group objects based on a key.

    Unlike `itertools.groupby`, this function does not require the input
    to be sorted.

    Parameters
    ----------
    objects : Iterable
        The objects to be grouped.
    key : callable
        The key function by which to group the objects. If
        `key(obj1) == key(obj2)` then `obj1` and `obj2` are in the same group,
        otherwise they are not.
    hashable : boolean (optional)
        Whether to use the key's hash to determine equality. By default, this
        will be determined by calling `key` on the first item in `objects`, and
        if it is hashable, the hash will be used. Using a hash is faster, but
        not possible for all keys.
    force_list : boolean (optional)
        Whether to force the returned `key_groups` iterator, as well as the
        `group` iterator in each `(key, group)` pair, to be lists.

    Returns
    -------
    keygroups : iterable
        An iterable of `(key, group)` pairs, where `key` is the key used for
        grouping, and `group` is an iterable of the items in the group. The
        nature of the iterables depends on the value of `force_list`.
